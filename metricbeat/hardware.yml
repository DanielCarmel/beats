# Add more queries as you want : 
# e.g: https://www.robvanderwoude.com/wmiqueries.php
# for each query type choose a name to display in the Kibana e.g - type:Win32_DesktopMonitor, name: monitor
# The query can get "type" only from Namespace - root/CIMV2 as default. 
# except - WmiMonitorID, a special ability added in the code to support it.

# Choose the data format type that will be sent yo Kibana 
# e.g -  use_type_as_key: true - will show the data with key of the "name" you chose above. 
# e.g -  use_constant_key: true - will show the data with key "data". 
# Both of them can be set to TRUE, But if none of them will be TRUE no data will be shown.
